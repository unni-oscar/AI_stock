## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)

## Phases

### Phase 1 

- Create folder for frontend for react with docker container
- structure React application in a professional, managable, scalable, and maintainable and high level and modern folder structure ?
- Create a sample page and run sample page on http://localhost:3033/

### Phase 2

- create backend folder for Laravel with docker container
- use PostgreSQL as db
- frontend and backend communication should be only through api call- 
- run sample backend page on http://localhost:3034/

Phase 3: API-Only Communication
- All frontend‚Äìbackend interactions should happen via REST APIs (no server-side rendering or blade views).
- The React frontend must communicate only via Laravel APIs, including:
  - Auth
  - File fetching
  - Data tracking

‚úÖ Phase 4: Backend Authentication Setup (Laravel)
- Implement basic authentication APIs:
  - POST /api/login ‚Üí issues JWT or session
  - POST /api/logout
  - Auth middleware for protecting endpoints
- Use Laravel Sanctum or Passport for token-based auth.

‚úÖ Phase 5: Login + Dashboard (React)
- Create a Login Page with fields:
  - Email
  - Password
- After successful login:
  - Store the JWT/token securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookie or localStorage)
  - Redirect the user to a Dashboard page
- Ensure protected routes are inaccessible without authentication

‚úÖ Phase 6: Registration Page (React + Laravel)
- Create a Registration Page with:
  - Email
  - Password
  - Name
- Implement POST /api/register on the Laravel backend
- After successful registration:
  - Auto-login or redirect to login page

‚úÖ Phase 7: NSE Bhavcopy Fetcher Page

üîê Access Control
- This page must be protected: only authenticated users can access it.

üìÖ UI: Bhavcopy Calendar (React)
1. Year dropdown:
   - List years from current year to 20 years ago.
2. Upon year selection:
   - Show 12 month blocks, each containing a calendar-style layout of dates
   - Dates should be shown in descending order (today ‚Üí backward)
   - Each month has a "Fetch Month" button

3. Calendar Behavior:
   - Processed days should be visually distinct
   - When "Fetch" is clicked:
     - Iterate from 1st to last day of the month
     - Fetch bhavcopy CSV for each date
     - Show processing status or progress loader
     - Update UI after each success/failure

üì§ Backend Logic (Laravel)
- CSV fetch URL (per day):  
  https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/products/content/sec_bhavdata_full_DDMMYYYY.csv
- Laravel will:
  - Download the CSV
  - Store it at:
    storage/app/bhavcopy-data/nse/{year}/{month}/sec_bhavdata_full_DDMMYYYY.csv

üìÇ Folder Structure (Backend)
storage/app/bhavcopy-data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nse/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {year}/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {month}/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sec_bhavdata_full_DDMMYYYY.csv

üîÅ Process Tracking
- Track downloaded (processed) dates by either:
  - Checking file existence OR
  - Using a DB table for processed days
- Used by frontend to style calendar UI appropriately

üîå Laravel API Endpoints

1. Get processed days
   GET /api/bhavcopy/processed-dates?year=YYYY
   Response:
   {
     "2024": {
       "6": [1, 2, 3],
       "7": [1, 2]
     }
   }

2. Fetch month data
   POST /api/bhavcopy/fetch
   Payload:
   {
     "year": 2024,
     "month": 6
   }
